The repository focuses on the subject of CBNST (Computer-Based Numerical and Statistical Techniques), containing various codes and algorithms, including:

- Bisection Method
- Iteration Method
- Secant Method
- Newton-Raphson Method
- Gauss Elimination Method
- Gauss-Jordan Method
- Gauss-Seidel Method
- Newton's Forward Interpolation Formula

The codes are written in the C programming language. As the subject leans more toward research fields, the codes and algorithms provided here are intended to help understand the application of these methods and formulas in both practical and research-based contexts.
I hope this is useful.
